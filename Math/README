This sublibrary is part of the QuantumMechanics library and is based on the open math library Eigen. It has been modified to handle Intel's MKL with the definition MKL_Complex8/16 as the STL std::complex<float/double>. As such, this library cannot be replaced directly with a newer version of Eigen without distroying the compilability with out modifying it first. Additionally, this version has a slightly different implementation of the Eigen-MKL translation functions and will not be usable under normal default MKL_Complex8/16 definitions.
